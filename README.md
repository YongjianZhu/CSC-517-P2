# Cases we have considered
* The same email address can be used for signing up for multiple roles.
* All validations has been added. You need to use true email format for registering account. And only real email can receive borrow success emails. For convevience of testing, we have removed strict format ISBN validation, instead, you need to put only integers in the ISBN field. (To use ISBN validation, simply use gem 'isbn_validation', and then using this syntax: "validates :isbn,   :isbn_format => true", which would be really annoying for general black box testing)
* Email will be sent to the registered email after 
  1) a book is borrowed and gotten by a student
  2) when a librarian approves a hold request and assigns the book to the student
  3) first student's book limit is reached, when next book is returned, the system will assign the returned book to the next hold request student.
* The fine is calculated using the function: Overdue fine of the library * overdue days

# Rspec testing for one model and one controller
* We wrote rspec tests thoroughly for university model and university controller. 
* To run the tests, import the project into Rubymine
* Run "rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test"
* Then run "bundle exec rspec" in the terminal. This should pass all of the examples in rspec.

* Receive an email when any of their book request is sucessful.

### Book Hold Request
* If the book is available, proceed to check out:
  * If the book is in Special Cllection list, add this to Librarian's approval list and wait. 
  * Otherwise, add the book to student's checked out list
* If the book is unavailable or the student has checked out **N** books already,
  * Inform the student that the book is unavailable or max limit reached.
  * Create a book hold request if the student wants to continue requesting.  
  
* Number of hold requests for a book should be visible to every user

### Returning a book
* If there is no hold request for a book, return and increase the available count of the book
* If there is a pending hold request,
  * Approve the hold request and add the book to the checked out list of the requested student
  * Send a mail to the student that the book is checked out.

## Notes
* There will be only one admin in the system, and this account will be preconfigured. 
* A librarian can add more than one book.  
* Each student can bookmark/request multiple books. They can also remove themselves from the bookmark/request list for a book.
* Itâ€™s up to you whether a user should be able to sign up as both an librarian and a student with the same email address or not.  Either way is OK.

## Miscellaneous

### Testing

### Bonus (Extra Credit)
You can do any or all of the below tasks for extra credit (each item below is worth **5 points**).
* No student/librarian should access any private content associated with other student/librarian/admin's account.
